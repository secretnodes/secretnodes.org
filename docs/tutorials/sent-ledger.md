# Use your Ledger with the Sentinel Network

Note: This guide is for Ledger Nano S or Ledger Nano X.

## Prerequisites

- This guide assumes you have a verified, genuine Ledger Nano S or X device.
- If you don't, or you using your Ledger device for the first time, you should check Ledger's [Getting Started](https://support.ledger.com/hc/en-us/sections/360001415213-Getting-started) guide.
- We also advise you to check your Ledger's genuineness and upgrade your firmware to the newest one available (`v1.6.0+`).
- Have a machine with [Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live) installed.

## Install Cosmos Ledger App

- Open Ledger Live and go to Settings (gear icon on the top right corner):

- Now go to Manager and search "Cosmos":

- Our binaries require at least Cosmos App Version `1.5.1` (if you only see a lower version available, like `1.0.0`, then you need to upgrade your Ledger firmware).

- Hit "Install" and wait for the process to complete.
