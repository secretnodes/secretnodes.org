# Looking to host or rent a NUC in the cloud?

We're currently working to secure data center space to host NUC's for Secret Node runners, security researchers, and others who may be interested in SGX machines in the cloud.

These are the options we're currently discussing.

1. Rent a NUC from us and we will configure it to meet your requirements. `Priced at $100 a month`.
2. Host your NUC with us in the Data Center space we secure. `Priced at $65 a month`.

We have the capacity to configure these as Secret Nodes using our automated tools, configurations beyond that must be discussed first.
**Please note, space will be extremely limited and we will only be able to accommodate a handful of NUC's from the community.**

If interested please start a conversation with us by emailing us at nuc@omnistake.com or sending a pm to [Ian](https://t.me/moonstash) or [Brendan](https://t.me/BrendanKitt) on Telegram.
