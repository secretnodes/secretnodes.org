NOTICE 2: The ENG to SCRT swap has been extended. It will close upon the passing of [proposal 27](https://secretnodes.com/secret/chains/secret-2/governance). Since this is a parameter change the only way for it to not close upon passing would be for the votes to change to no or the proposal to otherwise fail.

Final Notice : The swap ultimately ended on Jan 4th 2021 at 12:05pm PST. As of that time burning ENG for SCRT is no longer possible.

Hello everyone! It's been a long journey we've had since the [Secret Network launched in Feb 2020](https://blog.enigma.co/the-enigma-mainnet-has-launched-3bd0d40fe80d?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------). Since then the community has been working tirelessly to achieve a decenteralized token swap from ENG to SCRT. Here is a recap of the chain of events since launch.

## How long do I have to swap?

As stated in [The Token Swap Proposal](https://secretnodes.com/secret/chains/secret-2/governance/proposals/14), everyone had until the end of 2020.

## I missed the swap. What can I do?

The ENG to SCRT burn was a community run optional swap operated between 06-27-2020 and 01-04-2021, during this time those who wanted to burn their ENG tokens were minted SCRT at a 1:1 rate. As of 12-28-2020 the community voted to turn off the swap through [the "Disable & Remove ENG to SCRT Burn components"](https://puzzle.report/secret/chains/secret-2/governance/proposals/27) proposal. While we never intended to see anyone in enigma left behind, the network has overwhelmingly spoken in favor of disabling and removing the swap components. The Secret Network is a sovereign chain independent of the ENG token, with a different distribution than ENG, and launched by the community not a singular central entity.

If you have ENG your options are to try and sell them on an exchange. No further 1:1 swaps are happening any longer.
