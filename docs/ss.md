NOTICE 2: The ENG to SCRT swap has been extended. It will close upon the passing of [proposal 27](https://puzzle.report/secret/chains/secret-2/governance). Since this is a parameter change the only way for it to not close upon passing would be for the votes to change to no or the proposal to otherwise fail.

Final Notice : The swap was extended and ultimately ended on Jan 4th 2021 at 12:05pm PST. As of that time burning ENG for SCRT is no longer possible.

Hello everyone! It's been a long journey we've had since the [Secret Network launched in Feb 2020](https://blog.enigma.co/the-enigma-mainnet-has-launched-3bd0d40fe80d?source=collection_home---4------0-----------------------). Since then the community has been working tirelessly to achieve a decenteralized token swap from ENG to SCRT. Here is a recap of the chain of events since launch.
