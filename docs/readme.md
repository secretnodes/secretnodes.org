## Secretnodes.org About & Mission

Established in 2018, we're a grassroots organization that believes society is facing a fork in the road in regards to privacy, security, data rights and their trend towards further degradation. We aim to be a refuge at this impasse, and are committed to supporting the [Secret Network](https://scrt.network) by helping to empower its stakeholders.

## Notable Achievements
Since the launch of the Secret Network in Feb 2020, Secretnodes.org has achieved some notable things such as, being a genesis signer on the network, proposing and leading the Secret Swap, and authoring the first 3 community spend proposals: [Burn ENG for SCRT](https://puzzle.report/secret/chains/secret-1/governance/proposals/6), [The Puzzle Proposal](https://puzzle.report/secret/chains/secret-1/governance/proposals/8), and [The Testnet Proposal](https://puzzle.report/secret/chains/secret-1/governance/proposals/9).
