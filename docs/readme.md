## Secretnodes.org About & Mission

Established in 2018, we're a grassroots organization that believes society is facing a fork in the road in regards to privacy, security, data rights and their trend towards further degradation. We aim to be a refuge at this impasse, and are committed to supporting the [Secret Network](https://scrt.network) by helping to empower its stakeholders.
